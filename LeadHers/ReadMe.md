# Let's Dive into Deep Learning

Abstract:

Ever wondered what are the technologies used in Tesla's driverless car, chatbots such as Google Assitant & Siri, how does the face unlock of your smartphone works, how does Google Translator accurately translate phrases, and how are sounds being added in the silent movies?

If you want to get clarity on the above questions and want to kick start your journey with Deep Learning (a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence), join the live and interactive session which will introduce the unique type of algorithm based on Neural Networks to you which has far surpassed any previous benchmarks for the classification of images, text, and voice - unstructured data. Moreover, the session covers live coding of a Deep Neural Network with TensorFlow.
